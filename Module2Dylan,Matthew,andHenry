##Analysis

The map pictures portrays two aspects of the painted pottery we have collected data on. Firstly, the colors are representative of the dates/"era" of painters which painted them. The key for this is below:

Green: Classical Painters (Achilles Painter and Tyszkiewicz Painter)

Blue: Pioneer Group

Red: Archaic Painters (Kleitias and Sophilos)

The second aspect of the map includes the different shapes that can be seen. The legend for this is below:

Square: Krater/Krater-like shape

Circle: Non-Krater-like pottery

One clear trend that we see in our geographical map when we present a square for krater/krater-like vases versus non-krater-like pottery is that classical painters often produced krater-like vases.
As more vases started appearing, the spread of krater-like painters dwindled in the Mediterranean. The largest proportion of vases were found to be Greece, in the beginning,
and as the popularity of the intricate vases increased, more and more vases ended being found scattered across the Mediterranean coastline.

Our map is organized by color and what we are able to see is that early black figure vases made by classical painters are marked with green are located strictly in Italy.
As time went on the distribution of find-spots started began to reach out, shown by the blue pioneer group that are quite diverse. While ending with Archaic Painters that are shown to be only
in Greece and Turkey.
